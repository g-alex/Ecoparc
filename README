This software will allow us to automatically turn off some or all of the computers in the park 
(except if activity is detected on the machine) and to calibrate automatically the capacity of 
the machine following the user needs. A form will be filled for every machine: usage, 
statistics (activity, idle, percentage of use). The interface allow the user to controle every
computer on the park with the help of groups management, settings applied for a whole group, 
exctinction of the whole infrastructure, reboot and reporting of the consumption of the park and of 
every machine.
